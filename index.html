            <p> Hurling is an outdoor team game of ancient Gaelic Irish origin, played by men. 
                One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, the number of players and much terminology.
                 There is a very similar game for women called camogie, which shares a common Gaelic root. </p>
